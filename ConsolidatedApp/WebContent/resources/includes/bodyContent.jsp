							Motor vehicle emissions are the main source of air pollution in major cities, and make a substantial contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.
							<br /><br /><br />
							By driving your car an average of 50 kilometres a day, you contribute around 4 tonnes* of greenhouse gases, particulates and smog-causing pollutants to the atmosphere every year. This pollutes the air we breathe and contributes to environmental degradation.
